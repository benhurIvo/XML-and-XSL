# XML-and-XSL
The code in this project is used to write an XML schema and XSL transformation (XSLT) for the ACMTrento.xml file. The XML Schema describes the structure of an XML document while XSL Transformations (XSLT) is a standard way to describe how to change the structure of an XML file into another document with a different structure.
